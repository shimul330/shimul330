### Hi there 👋, My name is Shimul
#### I am a FullStack Devoloper


I am a passionate and dedicated full stack web developer with hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Tailwind CSS. On the backend, I work confidently with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I also integrate Firebase for authentication and real-time features, with secure API handling using JWT. I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly web applications that solve real-world problems. I'm a quick learner, constantly improving my skills and staying updated with the latest technologies. I’m actively looking for opportunities where I can contribute to impactful projects and grow as a valuable member of a professional development team.

Skills: JavaScript / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS

- 🔭 I’m currently working on this page.
